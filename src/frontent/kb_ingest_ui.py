kb_ingest_ui.py

This module defines the Streamlit interface for uploading, ingesting,
and deleting documents into a structured knowledge base within VaultFlex.

Features:
- Upload documents into a named scope (KB)
- Automatically preprocess, chunk, embed (FAISS), and extract triples (Neo4j)
- Skip already-ingested files using hash-based deduplication
- Support for deleting all files, vectors, and graph nodes for a given scope

    Renders the Streamlit UI for uploading and ingesting documents into a KB.

    Steps:
    1. User selects or creates a scope (knowledge base).
    2. User uploads one or more supported files.
    3. System checks for duplicates via file hash.
    4. New files are:
        - Stored in the bronze layer
        - Chunked and embedded into FAISS
        - Used to build a graph in Neo4j
    5. Optional: user can delete the entire scope and its assets.
